### Introduction

Here is the place where I want to put the projects that I developed. It was created using a template based on a Minimal Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages and it was provided by https://github.com/evanca.

If you want to use the template from @evanca please see the full step by step tutorial [on Medium](https://medium.com/@evanca/set-up-your-portfolio-website-in-less-than-10-minutes-with-github-pages-d0efa8ff56fd).
