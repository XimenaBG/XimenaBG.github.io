This chess set was made with the aim to practice several features of SolidWorks CAD software.
 <br>
The design of each chessman was taken from Titan of CNC Academy, an amazing website where you can find lots of helpful resources if you are interested in machining processes, CAD modeling or learn CAM.
<br>
You can find the technical designs used for this project in: [Titans of CNC Academy: Titan chess set](https://academy.titansofcnc.com/series/titan-chess-set)
