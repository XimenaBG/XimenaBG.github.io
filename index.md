## About me

*Welcome to my page!*
My name is Ximena and I am from Colombia. 
I am a mechanical engineer and recently I finished my M.Sc. in mechanical engineering in Brazil. 
During the last two years I have been learning about machining processes and metallic materials. I was studying the behaviour of the ASTM F75 alloy during a milling process, this material is used in the fabrication of knee and hip prostheses mainly, but is also an interesting alloy used in the aerospace industry because of its mechanical and thermal properties. I also have experience as a maintenance engineer, I worked in the mechanical maintenance area of a large cement company, where I had the opportunity to learn about crushers, roller and ball mills, as well as belt, chain, bucket and screw conveyors and bag filters. 
<br>
Nowadays, I am interested in ways to share my knowledge and maybe help somebody with it,
for that reason I create this portfolio to show a little bit my way of thinking, and I will put here some projects of CAD as well as information about my master's dissertation.
Also, I am passionate about airplanes and for that reason I will be working on a project that I have on my mind a long time ago and creating the memories in this site.
