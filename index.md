[Wear analysis of coated carbide endmills during the machining of ASTM F75 alloy.](/sample_page)
<br>
**Abstract:** Cobalt chromium alloys were first used in the biomedical industry in the mid-1930s to manufacture dental prostheses, thus becoming an interesting alternative to the existing ones produced in gold. Similarly, in recent decades these alloys have gained space in the production of artificial joints (knee and hip), traditionally made with stainless steel. The ASTM F75 alloy is a material that resists the action of highly corrosive and aggressive environments, such as the interior of the human body, and has a wear resistance superior to stainless steels, increasing the prostheses lives. However, the properties that guarantee the successful use of this material in this application are the same ones that hinder the productive processes necessary for the fabrication of prostheses in the forms and with the desired finishes. Therefore, the objective of this work is to contribute to the understanding of the phenomena that occurs during the machining of the ASTM F75 alloy, identifying the influence of cutting speed and feed on the wear of carbide end mills coated with AlTiN and AlCrN, as well as the evolution of the cutting forces over the life of tools. It was found that the increase in both cutting speed and feed rate impaired the tool lives and that the main wear mechanism observed in all conditions was adhesion. The superiority of the AlCrN coating was confirmed, which allows tools longer lives. Finally, in relation to the cutting forces, a gradual increase was observed with the increase in tool wear
