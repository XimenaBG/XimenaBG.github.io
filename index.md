## *Welcome to my page!*

My name is Ximena and I am from Colombia. 
I am a mechanical engineer and recently I finished my M.Sc. in mechanical engineering in Brazil, which is also where I currently live. 
<br>
During the last two years I have been learning about machining processes and metallic materials. I was studying the behaviour of the ASTM F75 alloy during a milling process. This material is used in the fabrication of knee and hip prostheses mainly, but is also an interesting alloy used in the aerospace industry because of its mechanical and thermal properties.
<br>
I also have experience as a junior maintenance engineer, I worked in the mechanical maintenance area of a large cement company, where I had the opportunity to learn about crushers, roller and ball mills, as well as belt, chain, bucket and screw conveyors and bag filters.

## My Interests

The purpose of this site is to share with more people my knowledge and my interests. Here I am going to talk about the results of my master's dissertation, I will published some parts drew using Solidworks and something related with statistics.
Nowadays I start to learn about the Finite Element Method and I have found really interesting all the concepts that support the simulations that you can develop using the method.
